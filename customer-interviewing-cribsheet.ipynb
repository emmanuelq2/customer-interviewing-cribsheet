    "\n",
    "* \"Do you think it's a good idea?\" (AWFUL.)\n",
    "  * _Opinions are worthless._\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"What would your dream product do?\" (MEH.)\n",
    "  * _People know their problems. Not how to solve them._\n",

    "  * _Some problems don't matter._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Talk me through the last time that happened.\" (GOOD.)\n",
    "  * _Watching somebody else do a task reveals where problems and blind spots really lie._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"What else have you tried?\" (GOOD.)\n",
    "  * _If they haven't already looked for a solution, they're not buying yours._\n",

    "* \"Would you pay X for a product that did Y?\" (BAD.)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"How are you dealing with the problem now?\" (GOOD.)\n",
    "  * _Stating a precise price is rare. They often show what a solution is tangentially worth._\n",

    "\n",
    "* \"Where does the money come from?\" (GOOD.)\n",
    "  * _Understand who owns the budget._\n",

    "  * _If you've got an interesting idea, this should be easy._\n",

    "* \"Is there anything else I should have asked?\" (GOOD.)\n",
